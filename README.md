# Overlay Mod

Basic overlay mod for coordinates, sprint, IRL time, and status effects.
- Coordinates: shows XYZ + direction & movement direction.
- Status Effects: Blinks at 10 seconds; gets pushed down by bossbars.
  - Works best with 4x GUI scale.
- Sprint Indicator: Just shows if sprint is toggled.
- Time: h:mm formatted IRL time.
